# Post-Quantum Cryptography: Dilithium Key Generation Example

## 1\. Overview

This project provides a simple Python script to generate a cryptographic key pair using the **CRYSTALS-Dilithium** algorithm. Dilithium is a digital signature scheme chosen by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a primary standard for post-quantum cryptography (PQC).

The purpose of this system is to create digital signatures that are secure against attacks from both classical and future quantum computers. The provided files include the Python script for key generation and the resulting public and private key files.

## 2\. File Descriptions

  * `keygen.py`: This is a Python script that uses the `dilithium-py` library to generate a new key pair. When executed, it produces two files: `server_public.key` and `server_private.key`.
  * [cite\_start]`server_public.key`: The generated public key[cite: 7]. This key is used to **verify** digital signatures. [cite\_start]It is designed to be shared publicly without compromising the security of the system[cite: 7].
  * [cite\_start]`server_private.key`: The generated private (or secret) key[cite: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. [cite\_start]This key is used to **create** digital signatures and must be kept absolutely secret[cite: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Anyone with access to this key can create valid signatures as the key's owner.

## 3\. Prerequisites

To run the key generation script, you need Python and the `dilithium-py` library installed.

```bash
pip install dilithium-py
```

## 4\. Usage

To generate a new key pair, simply run the `keygen.py` script from your terminal:

```bash
python keygen.py
```

Upon successful execution, you will see the following message printed to the console:
`Dilithium key pair generated (server_public.key, server_private.key).`

This will create or overwrite the `server_public.key` and `server_private.key` files in the same directory.

## 5\. Detailed Explanation of CRYSTALS-Dilithium

**CRYSTALS-Dilithium** is a digital signature algorithm built on the principles of lattice-based cryptography. Its security is derived from the mathematical difficulty of solving certain problems in lattices, such as the Shortest Integer Solution (SIS) and Learning With Errors (LWE) problems.

The key features of Dilithium are:

  * **Post-Quantum Security:** It is specifically designed to resist attacks from large-scale quantum computers running algorithms like Shor's algorithm, which can break current standards like RSA and ECC.
  * **Efficiency:** Compared to other post-quantum signature candidates, Dilithium offers a good balance between key size, signature size, and performance for signing and verification operations.
  * **Standardization:** It has been selected by NIST for standardization, indicating a high level of trust and scrutiny from the global cryptographic community.

### The Role of the Key Pair

In any asymmetric cryptography system, including Dilithium, operations are performed using a pair of mathematically linked keys:

  * [cite\_start]**Private Key (`sk`)**: This is the secret component, represented by `server_private.key`[cite: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. It contains the necessary information to generate a unique digital signature for a given piece of data (e.g., a message or a file). The security of the entire system relies on this key remaining confidential.

  * [cite\_start]**Public Key (`pk`)**: This is the public component, represented by `server_public.key`[cite: 7]. It can be freely distributed. Its function is to verify that a signature was created by the corresponding private key. When you receive a message with a signature, you use the sender's public key to run a verification algorithm. If the verification succeeds, you can be confident that the message is authentic (it came from the owner of the private key) and has not been tampered with.

## 6\. **IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE**

The `server_private.key` file contains sensitive cryptographic material. **It must be protected at all costs.**

  * **DO NOT** commit `server_private.key` to a public version control system like Git.
  * Ensure that file permissions on the server restrict access to this key.
  * If this key is compromised, an attacker can forge signatures and impersonate the key's owner. The only remedy is to revoke the public key and issue a new one.
